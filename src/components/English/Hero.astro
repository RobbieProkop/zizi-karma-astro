        <h2>Hi, I'm Yuli Prokop</h2>
        <p>
            Psychologist with over {years} years of practical experience. I work
            with both specific requests and emotional conditions at the root level
            that causes difficulties. The main methods I use are work with visualization,
            immersion in past emotionally significant situations and active listening.
