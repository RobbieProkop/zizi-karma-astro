<!-- It took me a long time to go to a psychologist, because I already had a bad experience with a non-professional, as it turned out later :( so it was very scary and difficult to decide on a second attempt, and my condition continued to worsen. -->

A friend of mine advised me Yulia (I won't get tired of thanking her for that). Outcome - Yulia identified one of my main problems in the first session; eradicated - on the second)) This is a person with some kind of magical energy, who completely disposes, she wants to tell everything to the smallest detail, cry, trust and get rid of her pain with her.

in general, now 5 of my friends go to Yulia)) and I never stop recommending her whenever I hear or feel that a person needs help. Yulia, thank you very much for your work and for you! and thank you for the fact that your support is not limited to our session, and you can always write to. And you are also interested in how we are there ❤️ this is very valuable!
