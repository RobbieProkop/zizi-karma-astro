I want to express my deep gratitude to fate, the Universe and all the sad circumstances that led me to Yulia. I have always been skeptical about psychology and did not really believe that I could open my soul to a stranger. But all this happened. Yulia's sensitivity and attentiveness allows you to openly share all your thoughts, even those that you cannot share with yourself. I am immensely grateful for every session I have had and I am not going to stop, because at these meetings I get to know myself anew, I learn to endure insults and traumas. At these meetings, I learn to live again.
